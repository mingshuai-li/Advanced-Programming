## Motivation
---
Generally image processing is a very comprehensive area and it is also suitable to use C++ to write image processing algorithms. In this project, we implement various operations on images, especially image enhancement, geometric transform and filtering.

### Sprint 1 (basics)
----

Input an image using a library such as [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) or [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) and implement various operations on images.

Basic types of operations on images: 
- Image Enhancement: brightness transform, inverse transform, gamma transform, log transform, normalization transform, threshold transform, window transform
- Geometric Transform: resizing, rotation, flipping left right, flipping up down
- Filtering: low pass filtering, high pass filtering, band pass filtering, Gaussian Filtering, Laplacian Filtering

Don't use classes. Functions are sufficient.


**Sprint 1: Definition of "done"**

The version will be considered as "complete" if 

- The project contains `README.md` file explaining the project
- Users can choose which operation to perform on images
- Users should be able to control the filter size
- The operations should be correct
